git add feature.txt  # Stage changes
git commit -m "Added new feature"  # Commit changes
git checkout main  # Switch to the main branch
git merge feature-branch  # Merge feature branch into main
git diff  # Compare changes between branches
git add conflict-file.txt  # Stage resolved conflict file
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"  # Complete the merge
